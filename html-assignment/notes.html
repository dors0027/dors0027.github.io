        <dt>Paragraph Tag</dt>
        <dd>To create a paragraph of text, < p > tag is required.</dd>
    
        <dt>Image Tag</dt>
        <dd>The < img > tag allows you to insert an image to your page. Although more is required to add an image, it would look like this: < img src="" alt="" > </dd>
    
        <dt>Head Tag</dt>
        <dd>The < head > tag contains all the information. As said in class, information about information. So, everything inside this tag won't actually show on the webpage.</dd>
    
        <dt>Body Tag</dt>
        <dd>The < body > tag contains everything showing on the webpage. All the content goes into the body. Again, as said in class, you wear a 'red shirt' on your body, not your head.</dd>
    
        <dt>Header Tags </dt>
        <dd>Header tags go from < h1 > to < h6 >. h1 being the most important and biggest, to h6 being least important and smallest. For example, a header tag can be used as a 'header' (litteraly) to a paragraph, or something else.</dd>
