                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, my name's Kevyn, a 19 year old college student at Algonquin College. I'm also the 2<sup>nd</sup> child of 4, with 2 brothers and a sister. 
                    I'm of Haitian descent and also have family ties in France, as that is where my father grew up. 
                    As you can probably guess, I speak French, which is in fact my 1<sup>st</sup> language. 
                    What you probably didn't guess is that I'm <em>actually</em> trilingual, speaking French, English and Creole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my biggest passions is football. European football. 
                    I've been playing since I was a toddler, and always dreamed of playing in the <abbr title="Union of European Football Associations">UEFA</abbr> Champions League. 
                    Growing up, my favorite player was Neymar. His way of dribbling, controlling and kicking the ball was nothing short of amazing to me. 
                    I remember him saying: <blockquote>A historic defeat cannot bow our heads forever. -<cite>Neymar Jr.</cite></blockquote> 
                    I feel a lot of people can relate to this because when life pushes you down, you must push through life and always keep your head up no matter what.
